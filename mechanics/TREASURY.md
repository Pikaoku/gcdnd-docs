# Wealth & the Treasury

While adventuring, a party will tend to accumulate masses of coins and gems and art objects and various trinkets. Thus, quite a lot of bookkeeping becomes necessary. 

We will be abstracting the wealth of the party into a party **treasury**.

## Glossary

* **expenditure**, something the party spends money on, represented with a wealth score
* **treasury**, an abstraction of the party's wealth, represented with a wealth score
* **wealth score**, a number between 0 and 9.

## Description

Simply, the treasury is a single number between 0 and 9: a **wealth score**. 

Services, vehicles, equipment etc are examples of **expenditures**, which also have a wealth score between 0 and 9. 

The party can freely purchase anything- given access to an appropriate vendor- with an *expenditure* wealth score **less than** the *treasury* wealth score.

Any expenditure with a wealth score **equal** to the treasury wealth score can be purchased, but the expense taxes your resources such that you cannot acquire new goods at that level or higher for two weeks.

If the object of your purchase is **one level higher** than your wealth score and your wealth score is above 0, you can acquire it, but the cost is so great that your wealth score is reduced by 1.

You cannot make purchases that are more than one level higher than your wealth score.

## Party Only!

This only affects the *entire party as an organization*. Individuals are still free to track coins and gems and make individual purchases.

## Examples

1. Thanks to a recently successful salvage run, the party’s wealth score just increased to 4. They have had their eyes set on a new cargo ship for a while now, which the GM has set at wealth level 5. They chooses to spend their savings to get the ship. Because it is one level higher than their current wealth score, their wealth is permanently reduced by 1, leaving them again with a wealth score of 3.

2. A local thieves’ guild has a wealth score of 5. They wants to outfit all of their men with new weapons, which the GM has decided equates to wealth level 5. They can complete the purchase, but it is so taxing on their resources that for the next two weeks they can only acquire goods that are below their wealth score.

3. Crazy Mac's adventuring party have panhandled their way up to a wealth score of 1. From now on, they can afford 3 square meals and a warm bed every night, because they are priced at wealth level 0.

## Lookup

If during the campaign we need to assing a wealth score to certain expenditures I will try to list it here.
