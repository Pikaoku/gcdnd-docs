# Carrying Capacity

To remove the need to tracks dozens of items each, there are simplified carrying capacity rules. 

Every character can carry a number of items equal to their strength ability score. So, Xan with 16 strnegth can carry 16 different items.

Only track the items that will actually affect the game. So, no, you don’t need to record your pants and shirt on your character sheet. But, your armor does count.

Multiple items of a similar nature that can be stowed together, such as twenty arrows in a quiver or a belt of healing potions, only count as a single item.

## Heavy Items

Some items have the heavy property. You can carry a number of heavy items equal to your strength modifier. Once you’re carrying your maximum number of heavy items, your speed is cut in half. A character with a zero strength modifier ow lower score cannot carry any heavy items.

Any metal weapon with the *two-handed* or *heavy* properties are examples of heavy items.

## One (Maybe Two) Bulky Items

Some items have the bulky property. You can carry one bulky item at no penalty. You can carry a second bulky item, but your speed is reduced to 5’.
