## Proficiency

Proficiency is used to represent what your character is good at. If you have proficiency in something, you're good at using it. The two most common usages of Proficiency are SKILLS and WEAPONS. 

Your proficiency bonus goes up as you level up. You add your proficiency bonus to any roll made with something you are good at.

For example, the Fighter class is proficient with all weapons. So they add their proficiency bonus to *any* attack roll they make with a weapon. Wizards, however, are not proficient with martial weapons. If they attempt to use a martial weapon they would not add their proficiency bonus to their ATTACK ROLL. 

# Combat

## Making an attack

An attack roll is any time you roll a d20 to hit (beat the AC of) a creature.

Attack rolls are calculated as such: 1d20 + one of your ability modifiers + your proficiency bonus, if you are proficient.

You use the ability modifier relevant to your activity. Strength for any melee weapon or for thrown weapons. Dexterity for melee weapons with the FINESSE property and all ranged weapons. If you are making an attack roll as part of any attack, for example Fire Bolt, you use your Spell Casting Ability modifier, i.e. Intelligence for a Wizard, Charisma for a Bard.

## Damage

The damage you do is determined by what you used to do the attack. 

When you successfully hit with a weapon attack roll (both ranged and melee) you add your *ability score modifier* that you used for the attack, to the damage. For example, a character with 16 strength would add +3 to their melee weapon attacks.

You do not add your modifier to spell damage unless the spell explictly says you do, or some other feature says you do.
