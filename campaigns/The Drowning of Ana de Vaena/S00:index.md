| 15 | Shadewater Keep | His legged tower shrunk, the cyclops was hopeless to defeat the party who brutalized him. They then began exploring the various rooms of Freya's keep: a teleportaion room to Tywellcors; a summoning circle; a map room; some bedrooms; and, a bigger-on-the-inside library containing the Solaris Codex! All that checked off, they set about ridding Freya's lands of demon worshippers, inadverantly summoning Iphrapheal, an ancient blue dragon.
| 16 | The Syndicate | Iphrapheal the Ringed arrived at the head of a cabal of dragons calling themselves the Syndicate. They claim their mission is to resuce The Accuser, the proto-dragon, from his infernal prison. Before dispersing his dragons to nearby islands, Iphrapheal stole the Solaris Codex and ordered Kotuviin the King Killer to destroy the party. Kotuviin was unsuccessful, and got his head lobbed off by Grognokek's axe.
