# Thus Ends Tunkesk

Started in the Navaran war camp surrounding Bartolome's Rest. Pre-battle festivities and reflection were going on throughout the camp. 

Bartolome approach Freya and handed her an old legal contract. King Vaasco, a Navaraan king from centuries ago, had made a deal with fae duke Codomes that the first of what humans call "Sea Elves" to arrive on Navara would be charged with protecting the Elkhart Wood at the center of the island. Part of the deal included a deed of ownership to the Elkhart Woods.

The party were invited to the war room where the plans for the attack were laid out. John suggested an amendment that was implemented.

That night the camp feasted. 

After a long rest the fleet set out to attack Navara City. The Navaran fleet was outnumbered three-to-one, but had specialized allies to help in the attack. Bartolome used his magic spyglass to fire a large destructive ray of magic at an Albergo ship, initiating combat.

Captain Dunbar spotted the Bloodless along the line of the Albergo fleet. As the ship transporting the party- now called the Lightning Jacks- passed their old ship Dunbar shrunk it, throwing off the crew and allowing it to be harpooned to the back of their current vessel. 

The party used several long range lightning based attacks to disable the sentry watchtower that was firing at their ships.

Landing on the dock, the party witnessed The Kraken enter the fray in the sea battle. Entire ships were being pulled under like it was easy. 

Rather than wade through the thick of the fighting the Lightning Jacks slipped into a sewer. There they were accosted by a Neothelid, a large ichor covered worm with an arsenal of tentacles coming out of its maw. The Neothelid successfully Feebleminded Dunbar, which was undone by Grognokek's expenditure of a wish.

While in the sewers the party found a near-death owl Aarockra who they saved.

Exiting the sewers and entering the barracks, the party encountered Captain of the Guard Rodrio Albergo. Dunbar frost his face and killed him instantly.

The tunnel under the barracks had been cleared, but was now filled with dazed civilians. A conveyor belt of commons later, the party arrived in Tunkesk's cavern. It was full of dazed children. Meabh snuck off to the side, Ally charged forth trigger a Mind Blast which swept through the cavern. 

The party advanced using ranged weapons at first. Meabh got in close, leapt off a pipe and stabbed Tunkesk in the back. Tunkesk tried to use Feeblemind on her but was blocked on account of her magic ring.

Another round of attacks later ended with Clonkers grabbing the Uiltharid by the tentacle, holding him still while Meabh lopped his squiddy head off. 

The dazed commoners regained consciousness, the party helped the children out of the cavern, and the fighting began to cease throughout the city.
