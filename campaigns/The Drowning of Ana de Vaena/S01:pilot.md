# Pilot

Five strangers, scattered throughout a crowd, witness a pirate-laden supply wagon hurtling dangerously through the bustling main street of Navara. 

Xan, the Triton, skewered the driver of the wagon on his trident. Captain Dunbar used a well timed thunderwave to halt the wagon in place, flipping it on it's back and throwing the pirates off. 

The only pirate to survive was a 9-ft goliath who started running down a side alley with Jared's spear stuck in him. The various strangers all joined in the chase for Gorouth. Horses were stolen. Eventually the goliath died.

On the body of Gorouth they found instructions from a woman named Ana de Vaena, a magic looking amulet and a barrel of blast powder. 

John asked a nearby barman what he knew about the name "Tunkesk", who was named in de Vaena's instructions. They learned Tunkesk was suspected to be a mind flayer who was active in these parts.

They also met an old grizzled man wrapped in a bear skin called Bartolome. He informed them that mere decades ago Navara was not quite as modernized. 

While talking to the barman the party learned that Ana de Vaena was a noble lady from Altocasa who was rather famously recently caught in a Kraken attacked which she managed to survive. She's said to have been a recluse since.

Additionally, they learn that it is hotly rumoured that someone has control of The Kraken. Popular candidates are: Count Lorencz, a rich and influential new-money member of Altocasan politics; Baron Rao, a war hungry leader of the Sahauaghin who has recently started attacking land dwellers; Balzryrrorth, a black dragon from the black mountain who leads the black army. 

While bantering about the bar the party were attacked by four men with tentacle tatoos on their head wearing tattered monkish robes. Who were then dispatched with little issue.
